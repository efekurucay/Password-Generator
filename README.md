# Password-Generator
Password Generator
This is a password generator that I created using C# and Windows Forms. It allows you to specify the character types that you want to include in the password.

How to use

To use the password generator, simply enter the desired length of the password and select the character types that you want to include. Then, click the "Generate" button. The password generator will then generate a random password that meets your criteria.

Character types

The password generator supports the following character types:

-Uppercase letters
-Lowercase letters
-Numbers
-Special characters

Tips for creating strong passwords

To create a strong password, it is important to include a variety of character types. This will make it more difficult for a hacker to guess your password.

Example

If you want a password that is 12 characters long and includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, you would enter the following settings:

Length: 12
Character types: Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Special characters
The password generator would then generate a password like this:
